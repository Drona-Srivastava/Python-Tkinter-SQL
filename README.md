# Python-Tkinter-SQL
This is a Project i thought of to organize the data of a company. I have introduced a few functions like Inserting a new record, Deleting a particular employee's data, Updating any information of an employee, Searching through the server for a particular employees record and also displaying all the employee's records.
I have used Python as the basic structure and Sql for database. I have also used Tkinter a module in Python to create a GUI as an upgrade to running command in Python terminal.
I have also mentioned comments to help anyone understand all the functionalities and organise the code
Developments to be done:-
Display record with search 
Give option with search criteria (search by name emp code or any other criteria)
